This simulation reproduces the model published in:

Lombardo P, Scuri R, Cataldo E, Calvani M, Nicolai R, Mosconi L,
Brunelli M. ACETYL-L-CARNITINE INDUCES A SUSTAINED POTENTIATION OF THE
AFTERHYPERPOLARIZATION Neuroscience vol 128/2 pp 293-303, 2004


NOTICE that these simulations are complex and take several minutes to
load and (some of them) several hours to run!


Example use:

Start SNNAP (double click on the SNNAP.jar file)
click on "Run Simulation"
Then in the new window "File"->"Load Simulation"
browse to and load bph_mixmod.smu file to load a simulation that
creates a figure similar to Fig6C from the paper and click "Start"
